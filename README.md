# TypeT5: Seq2seq Type Inference using Static Analysis

This repo contains the source code for the paper [TypeT5: Seq2seq Type Inference using Static Analysis](TODO).

## Installation

This project uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage the package dependencies, which tracks the exact package versions and manages the (project-specific) virtual environment for you. To install all dependencies, at the project root, run:
```bash
pipenv sync
```

If some dependencies are missing, you can install them via `pipenv install ..` (using `pipenv`) or `pipenv run pip install ..` (using `pip` from the virtual environment).
